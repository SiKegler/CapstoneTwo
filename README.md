Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how the body processes glucose. The purpose of this project is to come up with an accurate model for the diagnostic prediction of diabetes in patients, based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset focuses on females aged 21 and older of Pima Indian heritage and will leverage machine learning techniques to make these predictions. 
The dataset used in this analysis is a health dataset containing information related to factors that may influence the likelihood of a person developing diabetes. This dataset consists of 768 observations with 8 independent variables and 1 dependent variable, which indicates whether a person has been diagnosed with diabetes or not.
